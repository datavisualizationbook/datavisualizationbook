# **Linked Data Visualization Book: Techniques, Tools & Big Data**

Linked Data (LD) is nowadays a well established standard for publishing and managing structured information on the Web, gathering and bridging together knowledge from very different scientific and commercial domains. The development of Linked Data Visualization techniques and tools has been followed as the primary means for the analysis of this vast amount of information by data scientists, domain experts, business users and citizens. This book aims at providing an overview of the recent advances in this area, focusing on techniques, tools and use cases of visualization and visual analysis of LD. It presents all necessary preliminary concepts related to the LD technology, the main techniques employed for data visualization based on the characteristics of the underlying data, use cases and tools for LD visualization and finally a thorough assessment of the usability of these tools, under different business scenarios. The goal of this book is to offer interested readers a complete guide on the evolution of LD visualization and empower them to get started with the visual analysis of such data.
